    <p>Voting online takes a few necessary steps. Please follow these instructions to vote in Boston Massachussets.</p>

      <p>1) You must be a United States citizen and a resident of Massachusetts to vote. You have to be 18 on or before Election Day. If you’re 18 after the deadline but before Election Day, you can register to vote. You still need to register by the deadline though.<br>
    2) You must register 20 days before all primaries and general elections. The deadline also applies to when you change your address or political party.<br>
3) If you moved within Boston — or moved to the City from another part of the state — you'll have to re-register with your new address. There's no residency waiting period in Massachusetts. You can register as soon as you move to your new address.

      <p>The state online system is the easiest way to register. You can register to vote, make changes to your contact information, and change your party status.
Visit the state’s Voter Registration website. You'll need:
a valid driver's license, learner's permit, or State ID, and
a signature on file with the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
If you don't have an ID, you can fill out the form online and mail it.
If you have questions about the website, contact the state Elections Division at 617-727-2828.</p>
